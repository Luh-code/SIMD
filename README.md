# SIMD
A header-only library to help with SIMD intrinsics for high-performance computing written in C

## Indev
This library in neither fully tested nor feature complete. There is no choosing between which version of SSE you want to use either (SSE 2 is assumed)
Matrix operations will be added in the future, though right now only vector intrinsics are covered.
